# Flutter Algorithm Visualizations

![Flutter Logo](https://flutter.dev/images/flutter-logo-sharing.png)

Welcome to my repository! Here, I explore algorithms and visualize them using Flutter, a popular cross-platform app development framework. My aim is to create simple projects that demonstrate various algorithms in action.

## About

In this repository, you'll find a collection of Flutter projects showcasing different algorithms. Each project focuses on visualizing a specific algorithm, making it easier to understand its inner workings. Whether you're new to algorithms or looking to deepen your understanding, these projects provide an interactive way to learn.

## Projects

- **Selection Sort **: Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and moving it to the beginning.
